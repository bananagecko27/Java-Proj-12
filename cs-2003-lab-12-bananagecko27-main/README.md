# CS-2003-Lab-12

## Overview
The twelth lab is intended to introduce to the implementation of the heap sort algorithm.

Youâ€™ve been provided with two files: HeapSort.java and lab12.txt. **HeapSort.java** contains the implementation of the heap sort algorithm and a main method to apply the algorithm to the input sequence. **lab12.txt** contains an input list of integers.

The heap sort algorithm works by first constructing a heap from the input array and then repeatedly dequeuing every element. Since the heap guarantees that the first element is the highest priority (smallest for ascending or largest for descending), the elements will come out insorted order.

This algorithm can be implemented in-place, which we'll do for this lab. To implement the algorithm in-place, we dequeue each element from the heap by swapping it with the last
unsorted element in the array. We also maintain a number of unsorted elements, which is the same as the size of the heap.

NOTE: When removing elements from a heap, we often use the term *dequeue* because a heap is also a type of queue known commonly as a priority queue.

```pseudo
procedure HeapSort(arr, first, last)
=====================================
n <- last - first + 1
for i in (first + n / 2 - 1)..=first do
    Heapify(arr, i, n)
end for
for i in last...first do
    arr[first], arr[i] <- arr[i], arr[first]
    Heapify(arr, first, i - first)
end for
end procedure
```

```pseudo
procedure Heapify(arr, root, n)
=====================================
left <- 2 * root + 1
right < 2 * root + 2
let largest :=
    if left < n and right < n then
        max(arr[root], arr[left], arr[right])
    else if left < n then
        max(arr[root], arr[left])
    else if right < n then
        max(arr[root], arr[right])
    else
        arr[root]
    end if
if arr[root] != largest then
    if arr[left] == largest, then
        arr[root], arr[left] <- arr[left], arr[root]
        Heapify(arr, left, n)
    else
        arr[root], arr[right] <- arr[right], arr[root]
        Heapify(arr, right, n)
    end if
end if
end procedure
```

## Assignment
Finish the implementation of the partition method in the QuickSort class. The partition method should randomly select a pivot value, partition the input array, and return the pivot index.

Use **TUGrader.java** to ensure that all unit tests in the provided test file(s) pass.

## Submission
The assignment is due by the end-of-day Friday of the following week.

*To submit your work, please review the **Commits** section below.*

## Grading Rubric
- [ ] (100pts) Can sort a list of integers

## Compiling and Testing Code
Your IDE should provide tools to compile your code. If you're unfamiliar with that process, you can research it online or ask. Most developers compile their code from command line using a shell script, such as a **Makefile** or build script (**build.sh**). I've provided build scripts for you in both *Powershell* and *Bash*. Refer to the following directions on how to use these scripts based on the terminal that you're using. If you're on Windows, please use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), Git Bash, or Powershell, not Command Prompt.

### Windows Users (Powershell)
- To compile your code: `./build.ps1`
- To compile and run your code: `./build.ps1 run` (forwards clargs to program)
- To compile and test your code: `./build.ps1 test` (forwards clargs to TUGrader)
- To format your code: `./build.ps1 fmt`
- To sync your code: `./build.ps1 sync`
- To submit your code: `./build.ps1 submit`
- To remove class files: `./build.ps1 clean`

### Windows Users (WSL, Git Bash), Mac and Linux Users
- To compile your code: `./build.sh`
- To compile and run your code: `./build.sh run` (forwards clargs to program)
- To compile and test your code: `./build.sh test` (forwards clargs to TUGrader)
- To format your code: `./build.sh fmt`
- To sync your code: `./build.sh sync`
- To submit your code: `./build.sh submit`
- To remove class files: `./build.sh clean`

These scripts use the following commands. Note that Windows users need to replace the colon with a semicolon in the Java classpath.
- To compile a Java file: `javac -d target -cp lib/*:src <filepath>.java`
- To execute a Java file: `java -cp lib/*:target <package-path>.<filename>`
- To format a Java file: `java -jar lib/google-java-format.jar --replace --skip-javadoc-formatting <filepath>.java`
- To remove class files: `rm -r target/*`

## Code Style
All code should follow the [Google Java style guidelines](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). If you find anything in the code that does not follow the style guidelines, feel free to fix it, but you are not required to do so. Only your handwritten code will be evaluated for its style. You do not need to follow the style guidelines to the letter but egregious deviations from the style guidelines will be penalized. A submission that passes all test cases but does not use an appropriate style will not receive an A for the assignment.

For those using an IDE, such as Eclipse or VS Code, the IDE should provide a formatting tool. I've included the XML specification of the Google Java Style Guidelines at `.vscode/java-google-style.xml`. You can configure your IDE to use the provided XML as its formatting rules to format your code to the Google Java Style Guidelines, which are the industry standard.

If you're working from command-line, [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) is an open-source formatting tool that you can use to format your files. You can use the following commands to format your code depending on your terminal.
- `./build.ps1 fmt`
- `./build.sh fmt`

## Commits
Commits should be made incrementally. Many commits are always better than few, and commits can always be squashed together later if there are too many. You should try to make a commit every time you've made tangible progress in the development of your code.

Every commit should have a commit message. The standard format for commit messages is to start with a verb in present-tense followed by a concise message (typically less than 50 characters) that summarizes the change that the commit is introducing to the repo. For example, "Updates README", "Implements Array", "Passes testGet".

Popular IDEs, such as Eclipse and VS Code, provide integrated Git tools. If you're on Windows, you can install Git Bash or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). If you're on Mac or Linux, you already have git installed.

If you've just installed git, it will need to be configured. The easy way to configure git is from a terminal. Use the following commands.
- `git config --global user.name "<github-username-goes-here>"`
- `git config --global user.email "<github-email-goes-here>"`
- `git config --global pull.rebase true` (optional)
- `git config --global fetch.prune true` (optional)
- `git config --global diff.colorMoved zebra` (optional)

To sync changes made from another device, use the following command.
- `git fetch origin main`
- `git pull origin main`

To push commits from command line, use the following commands.
- `git add -A`
- `git commit -m "<your message goes here>"`
- `git push origin main`

You can also sync all changes and submit with the following commands depending on your terminal.
- `./build.ps1 submit`
- `./build.sh submit`
